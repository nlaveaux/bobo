I matter
I am allowed to take up space
I push through everything no matter how hard it is
Being cringy doesnt stop me from doing what i enjoy
I don't get discourage from failure I learn from it and move forward
I am confident in everything I do
The things I own end up owning me. It's only after I shed everything that shackles me that I am free to do anything
I have to know, Not Fear, That someday I'm are going to die. Until I know that and embrace that, I'm Useless
This is my life and its ending one minute at a time
Stop trying to control everything, let go. let go
